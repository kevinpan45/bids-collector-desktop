# Implementation Summary: Separate Collection Tasks per Storage Location

## ✅ **COMPLETED: Auto-Start Collection Tasks + Separate Tasks per Location**

I have successfully implemented both requested features:

### 1. Auto-Start Collection Tasks (Previous)
- Collection tasks now automatically start downloading after creation
- Configurable via settings (`download.autoStartTasks`)
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly feedback

### 2. Separate Collection Tasks per Location (New)
- **Problem Solved**: When selecting multiple storage locations, the system now creates separate collection tasks for each location instead of one task with multiple destinations.

## Key Benefits

### Independent Task Management
- ✅ **Individual Progress**: Each location has its own progress bar and status
- ✅ **Granular Control**: Start, stop, pause, or retry downloads per location
- ✅ **Better Error Handling**: One location failure doesn't affect others  
- ✅ **Parallel Downloads**: Each task downloads simultaneously for faster completion
- ✅ **Selective Management**: Delete or retry specific location downloads

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Clear Task Names**: `"Download: Dataset Name → Location Name"`
- **Accurate Feedback**: System tells you exactly how many tasks were created
- **Better Progress Tracking**: See individual completion status per destination
- **Simplified Interface**: Each task shows only one destination in Collections page

## Implementation Details

### New Function: `createCollectionTasksForLocations()`
```javascript
// Creates separate tasks for each location
const tasks = await createCollectionTasksForLocations(dataset, [location1, location2, location3]);
// Result: 3 separate tasks, one per location
```

### Updated Workflow
1. **User selects 3 storage locations**
2. **UI shows**: "3 locations selected - 3 separate collection tasks will be created"
3. **Button shows**: "Create Collection Tasks (3 Tasks)"
4. **System creates**: 3 independent tasks
5. **Auto-start**: All 3 tasks begin downloading if enabled
6. **Feedback**: "All 3 downloads started automatically!"

### Collections Page Display
- Each location appears as a separate, manageable task
- Independent controls and status for each download
- Cleaner interface since each task has one destination

## Technical Excellence

### Backward Compatibility
- Original `createCollectionTask()` function preserved
- Existing functionality unchanged
- No breaking changes

### Error Handling
- Graceful auto-start failures with fallback to manual start
- Clear user feedback for all scenarios
- Robust error recovery

### Settings Integration
- Auto-start behavior configurable in Settings page
- Settings persist across sessions
- Reactive UI updates when settings change

## Files Modified

1. **`src/lib/collections.js`**
   - Added `createCollectionTasksForLocations()` function
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing function

2. **`src/routes/dataset/+page.svelte`**
   - Updated to create separate tasks per location
   - Enhanced auto-start logic for multiple tasks
   - Improved user feedback and button text

3. **`src/lib/settings.js`** (Previous)
   - Added `download.autoStartTasks` setting

4. **`src/routes/settings/+page.svelte`** (Previous)
   - Added UI control for auto-start setting

## User Scenarios

### Scenario A: Single Location
- Selects 1 location → Creates 1 task → Works exactly as before

### Scenario B: Multiple Locations  
- Selects 3 locations → Creates 3 separate tasks → Each can be managed independently

### Scenario C: Mixed Success
- 3 tasks created, 2 start successfully, 1 fails → User gets clear feedback about what happened

## Result

✅ **Better Performance**: Parallel downloads instead of sequential
✅ **Better Control**: Individual task management per location  
✅ **Better Reliability**: Isolated failures don't affect other downloads
✅ **Better UX**: Clear progress and status per destination
✅ **Better Workflow**: Auto-start + separate tasks = optimal experience

The implementation provides a significantly improved download experience while maintaining full backward compatibility and adding granular control that users need for managing multiple storage destinations.
